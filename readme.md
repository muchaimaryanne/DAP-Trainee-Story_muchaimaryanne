# ðŸ“ˆðŸ§ª Data Analytics Program ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š : Story of *___Maryanne_Muchai__*
This is my experience in the Azubi Africa Data Analytics Program.

## Let me introduce Myself
`My name is Maryanne Muchai. I am an IT professional with experience in end-user support. Before I joined Azubi Africa DAP program, I worked in customer service, having held previous roles in IT end-user support. However, my background is in IT. I joined the program with the aim of redirecting my career back to IT and specifically data analysis.`


## How would I describe my experience in the data analytics program?Â 
`My experience in the DAP was insightful but also challenging. I really learned a lot, not only technical skills but also soft skills
 like teamwork and communication. I met people I would never have met otherwise and made new friends and connections. I was pushed due to the fact that I was juggling both the program and work but it made me better and I really appreciate the Azubi community for the opportunity.`

## How would I say the Career Accelerator phase has introduced me to when it comes to data analytics ?Â 
`The career phase exposed me to different kinds of real-world projects. In doing so I got familiar with different technologies, platforms, frameworks, and approaches that I can use to handle each one of them.`

## What enticed me to join the Data Analytics Program?
`I wanted a program that not only provided the material but also people that would guide me along the way.`

## What would I say my progress in tech has been since joining the program?Â 
`The progress I have made in tech I would say is learning data analysis. I have a firm foundation and skills that I can build on and grow.`

## What are my plans for the future ?
`I plan to continue learning and to join a group or workplace where I can practice and sharpen my skills.`

## What is my dream company or role ?
`My dream role is a to be a data scientist where I can also train others.`

## 1st Phase Projects' Summary Table
`These are the projects that I completed during the first phase of the program.`
